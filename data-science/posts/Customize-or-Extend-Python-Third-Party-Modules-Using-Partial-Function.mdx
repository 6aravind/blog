# Customize or Extend Python Third-Party Modules Using Partial Function 

 Let me explain with an example.

## Introduction 

Partial functions allow us to fix values for some arguments of a
function and generate a new function. The common example for partial
function would be:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/6aravind/69278ae3c5d6861c33013c4cc207892e#file-example-py"> </script>

This example is a solid starter example for partial functions, but feels
more like a syntactic sugar rather than functionality gain. Partial
function shines, when you are restricted by third party modules or code
which you have no control over.

## Example Brief 

I was playing around with [Matplotlib
Animation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/animation_api.html) module and found that [save
method](https://matplotlib.org/stable/_modules/matplotlib/animation.html#Animation.save) has a progress callback function. Callback function
takes two arguments (current\_frame & total\_frames), but a progress bar
without metadata like file name and elapsed time is not very useful. So
we will use *Partial Function* to enhance it.

## Write to disk

## Takeaway 

Partial functions give you more control, especially when you are adding
features on top of code written by others.

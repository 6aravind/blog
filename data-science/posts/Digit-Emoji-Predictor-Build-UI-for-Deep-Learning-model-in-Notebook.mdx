# Digit Emoji Predictor: Build UI for Deep Learning model in Notebook 

Build a digit emoji predictor in Jupyter notebook by passing data between JavaScript & Python. Typically, JavaScripts are used for data visualization in notebooks, but it can also be used for prototyping front-end/UI for deep learning models. 

## Why the hell build UI in Notebook?

Short Answer:

> Share the Deep Learning model notebook with colleagues from different
> teams like Business, Data Science, Front End developer, DevOps for
> their opinion before the real software development takes place.

Jupyter notebook is meant for quick prototyping and everyone knows this
but what many misses is we can also do a quick prototype of UI as well.
Many data scientists are **quick to start** building the big deep
learning model with whatever little data they have without even thinking
about what they are developing and for whom 🤷‍♂️. Trust me, the first
model you are satisfied with (based on the metrics like accuracy) won't
be deployed into production for various reasons like slow inference
time, no on-device support, memory hogging blah blah.

 
Even experienced project/product managers sometimes won't know what
they really want so first try to get the workflow or pipeline agreement
from all the players involved, even with this some things will slip
through the crack. " I am data scientist, My job is only to build ML
models is not the right mindset, at least in my opinion." A tad bit of
knowledge in Business, Web development, DevOps can help you save a ton
of time in trying to debug, or explain why the model/workflow you built
is the best for business. Better to be jack of all trades here. BTW,
this does not mean that you should take over the responsibilities of
your colleagues. Just try to get a sense of what is happening outside
your circle. In this post, Let me share an example of how creating a
simple UI for input & output for deep learning model can help you see
the cracks in your workflow and increase productivity.

## Application 

If you are not familiar with
[MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) dataset then just know that you can build a **Digit
Emoji Predictor** as the dataset contains greyscale images of hand-drawn
digits, from zero through nine. So our UI is going to let the user draw
a digit & display the corresponding emoji.

Firstly, we will decide what we are going to build? Instead of creating
from scratch let us try to recreate [Digit
Recognizer](https://towardsdatascience.com/deploying-your-first-deep-learning-model-mnist-in-production-environment-510bfdc4808d) in notebook without using Django. The use case we
have chosen is great because we can't simply use
`pywidgets`, this forces us to dig deep
into the world of HTML & JavaScript. In the longer run this route has
more benefits because of unlimited capability, free resource and more
importantly closer to the actual front-end. Of course if all you want is
a slider then just roll with `pywidgets`.
We will first set up the back-end and then get back to the UI.

## Digit Emoji Recognizer 

I have trained the CNN Deep learning model using the
`pytorch`, we will just download the
model & weights from
[MNIST Model](https://github.com/6aravind/tidbits/blob/main/assets/models/mnist_model.pth). This is a simple model with 3 *Conv blocks* and 2
*Fully connected layers*. The Transformations used for this model are
`Resize` & `ToTensor` Upon calling the `predict` function on the image, we will get the predicted digit.

``` 
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torchvision import transforms

# Digit Recognizer model definition
class CNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=5)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 32, kernel_size=5)
        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(32,64, kernel_size=5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(3*3*64, 256)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = F.dropout(x, p=0.5, training=self.training)
        x = F.relu(F.max_pool2d(self.conv2(x), 2))
        x = F.dropout(x, p=0.5, training=self.training)
        x = F.relu(F.max_pool2d(self.conv3(x),2))
        x = F.dropout(x, p=0.5, training=self.training)
        x = x.view(-1,3*3*64 )
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.dropout(x, training=self.training)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x



# Predict the digit given the tensor
def predict(image, modelName = 'mnist_model.pth'):

    # Resize before converting the image to Tensor
    Trfms = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize(28), transforms.ToTensor()])

    # Apply transformations and increase dim for mini-batch dimension
    imageTensor = Trfms(image).unsqueeze(0)

    # Download model from URL and load it
    model = torch.load(modelName)

    # Activate Eval mode
    model.eval()

    # Pass the image tensor by the model & return max index of output
    with torch.no_grad():
        out = model(imageTensor)
        return int(torch.max(out, 1)[1])
```

We need a helper function to convert **BASE64 Image** (canvas area in
which the user is going to draw the digit) to **PIL Image**.

``` 
import re, base64
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# Decode the image drawn by the user
def decodeImage(codec):

    # remove the front part of codec
    base64_data = re.sub('^data:image/.+;base64,', '', codec)

    # base64 decode
    byte_data = base64.b64decode(base64_data)

    # Convert to bytes
    image_data = BytesIO(byte_data)

    # Convert to image & convert to grayscale
    img = Image.open(image_data).convert('L')
    return img
```

Now let us combine the two functions namely `decodeImage` and `predict` as a
separate function. This way is easier because the output of the function
(emoji html code) can be directly passed to the HTML tag via JavaScript.
Hang on for a bit if you are confused, things will get much easier to
follow in the next section.

``` 
# Decode the image and predict the value
def decode_predict(imgStr):

    # Decode the image
    image = decodeImage(imgStr)

    # Declare html codes for 0-9 emoji
    emojis = [ 
            "&#48;&#65039;&#8419;",
             "&#49;&#65039;&#8419;",
             "&#50;&#65039;&#8419;",
             "&#51;&#65039;&#8419;",
             "&#52;&#65039;&#8419;",
             "&#53;&#65039;&#8419;",
             "&#54;&#65039;&#8419;",
             "&#55;&#65039;&#8419;",
             "&#56;&#65039;&#8419;",
             "&#57;&#65039;&#8419;"
    ]

    # Call the predict function
    digit = predict(image)

    # get corresponding emoji
    return emojis[digit]
```

### UI 

The HTML & CSS part are quite straight forward, the JavaScript lets the
user draw inside the canvas and call functions via the buttons
`Predict` & `Clear`The `Clear` button
cleans up the canvas and sets the result to 🤔 emoji. We will set up the
`Predict` button JS function in the next
section.

``` 
from IPython.display import HTML

html = """
<div class="outer">
        <! -- HEADER SECTION -->
    <div> 
        <h3 style="margin-left: 30px;"> Digit Emoji Predictor &#128640; </h3> 
        <br>
        <h7 style="margin-left: 40px;"> Draw a digit from &#48;&#65039;&#8419; - &#57;&#65039;&#8419;</h7>
    </div>

    <div>
           <! -- CANVAS TO DRAW THE DIGIT -->
        <canvas id="canvas" width="250" height="250" style="border:2px solid; float: left; border-radius: 5px; cursor: crosshair;">
        </canvas>

            <! -- SHOW PREDICTED DIGIT EMOJI-->
        <div class="wrapper1"> <p id="result">&#129300;</p></div>

            <! -- BUTTONS TO CALL DL MODEL & CLEAR THE CANVAS -->
        <div class="wrapper2">
            <button type="button" id="predictButton" style="color: #4CAF50;margin:10px;">  Predict </button>  
            <button type="button" id="clearButton" style="color: #f44336;margin:10px;">  Clear </button>  
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
"""


css = """
<style>
    .wrapper1 
    .wrapper2 

    .outer 

</style>
"""


javascript = """

<script type="text/javascript">
(function() ());

</script>

"""


HTML(html + css + javascript)
```

![UI for the Digit Emoji
Predictor](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bgVq7XSSIWan1ibCBS215g.png)

Great! We are able to draw inside the canvas and upon clicking the
`Clear` button, canvas is cleaned up. The
tricky part starts when the user clicks the `Predict` button as we have to do the following:

-   [JS to Python
    👉 ](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/06/01/ipython-notebook-javascript-python-communication/) Grab the drawing inside the canvas and pass it
    to python

``` 
/* PASS CANVAS BASE64 IMAGE TO PYTHON VARIABLE imgStr*/
    var imgData = canvasObj.toDataURL();
    var imgVar = 'imgStr';
    var passImgCode = imgVar + " = '" + imgData + "'";
    var kernel = IPython.notebook.kernel;
    kernel.execute(passImgCode);
```

-   [Python to JS
    👉 ](https://towardsdatascience.com/javascript-charts-on-jupyter-notebooks-dd25f794cf6a) Set the predicted emoji as the value of HTML
    element (`#result`)

``` 
/* CALL PYTHON FUNCTION "decode_predict" WITH "imgStr" AS ARGUMENT */
    function handle_output(response) 
    var callbacks = ;
    var getPredictionCode = "decode_predict(imgStr)";
    kernel.execute(getPredictionCode, callbacks, );
```

Linking all together.

``` 
predictJS = """
```

``` 
<script type="text/javascript">

/* PREDICTION BUTTON */
$("#predictButton").click(function() );
</script>

"""
HTML(predictJS)
```

![Wrong
Predictions](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EaY062wnD67D-2GdWPhlIA.gif)

We have both good & bad news, the good thing is data connection between
Python and JavaScript works, but the prediction values are all wrong
(mapped to same value --- 8). Let us compare the canvas image passed to
python and MNIST dataset image.

![Compare the images from Canvas
and MNIST](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*95bvFdgObTZMaJ9zGagwMw.png)

It is very clear now that we need to `invert` the image because the model was trained on the dataset
with black background and white strokes.

``` 
import PIL.ImageOps

# Decode the image and predict the value
def decode_predict(imgStr):

    # Decode the image
    image = decodeImage(imgStr)

    # Invert the image as model expects black background & white strokes
    image = PIL.ImageOps.invert(image)

    # Declare html codes for 0-9 emoji
    emojis = [ 
            "&#48;&#65039;&#8419;",
             "&#49;&#65039;&#8419;",
             "&#50;&#65039;&#8419;",
             "&#51;&#65039;&#8419;",
             "&#52;&#65039;&#8419;",
             "&#53;&#65039;&#8419;",
             "&#54;&#65039;&#8419;",
             "&#55;&#65039;&#8419;",
             "&#56;&#65039;&#8419;",
             "&#57;&#65039;&#8419;"
    ]

    # Call the predict function
    digit = predict(image)

    # get corresponding emoji
    return emojis[digit]
```

Awesome! It works.

## Conclusion 

Now you can quickly share this notebook with everyone and ask for their
opinion. Don't forget to mention the caveat that this is an early
prototype. Without much effort, we sort of replicated the
functionalities of a web app. The biggest plus is we never left the
comfort of notebook and potentially bridged the gap between Training &
Test data.

Hopefully I managed to convince you that basic web developer skills are
really helpful for a data scientist. The notebook can be accessed from

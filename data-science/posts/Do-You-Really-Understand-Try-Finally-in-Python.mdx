# Do You Really Understand Try & Finally in Python?

In python, `try` and `except` blocks are often used by programmers for handling any exception or unhappy scenarios. `Finally` clause is very under appreciated & can be better utilised. Let us check out how *final-block* works.

## **Deep dive**

> No matter what happened previously, the final-block is executed once
> the code block is complete and any raised exceptions handled. Even if
> there's an error in an exception handler or the else-block and a new
> exception is raised, the code in the final-block is still run.

This quote from the python
[documentation](https://docs.python.org/2.5/whatsnew/pep-341.html) is absolutely correct but the execution behavior is
little tricky when `try` and
`finally` blocks are encapsulated within
a function which has a `return`
statement. Let me explain with examples. See if you could guess the
output of the following functions.

### Example 1: 

```python
# Both the try & final blocks have print statements and function returns value from final-block
def example_1():
    try:
        val = 1
        print(f"Print: Try Block - ")
    finally:
        val = val + 1
        print(f"Print: Finally Block - ")
        return f"Return: Finally Block - "
    
example_1()
```

Function `example_1` is simple and
straight, first the *try-block* gets executed and then *final-block*.
The variable `val` has value **1** in
*try-block* and gets updated to **2** in *final-block*.


### Example 2:

```python
# The try block has return statement & final block has only print statement
def example_2():
    try:
        val = 1
        print(f"Print: Try Block - ")
        return f"Return: Try Block - "
    finally:
        val = val + 1
        print(f"Print: Finally Block - ")
        
example_2()
```

![Example 2 - output](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sbi8YhzY3cIbC3g6-YMaBg.png)

Function `example_2` is where things get
a bit tricky, the `return`statement in
*try-block* is executed after the *final-block* but the value of the
variable `val`returned is not affected
by the changes made in the *final-block*.

### Example 3:

```python
# Both the try & final blocks have return statements
def example_3():
    try:
        val = 1
        print(f"Print: Try Block - ")
        return f"Return: Try Block - "
    finally:
        val = val + 1
        print(f"Print: Finally Block - ")
        return f"Return: Finally Block - "
    
example_3()
```

![Example 3 - output](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IT65Lt1_FIKBxRuzXnXgnA.png)

Output of the function `example_3` is
easy to guess. When the `return`
statement in *final-block* is executed, the function exits so the
`return` statement in *try-block* is
never executed.

`try` & `finally`blocks are not quite as straight forward as one might
think, especially when they are returning values from a function. For
more such interesting tidbits follow me via
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/6aravind). The takeaways from this post are:

1.  Where you put the `return`
    statement is going to make a difference.
2.  Even though the `return` statement
    from *try-block* is executed after the *final-block*, value of the
    variable returned won't be affected by alteration made in the
    *final-block*.

# Do You Visualize DataLoaders for Deep Neural Networks? 

A lot of factors can affect the performance of a Deep Neural Network. Let's see how we can set up a PyTorch pipeline for Image augmentation (with help of Albumentations Python library), and use visualization to find any potential issue before it costs you time and money.

In software development when something is wrong, usually we get an
error, but with data science this is not the case. If the model is not
performing well, then the general approach is to alter the model
architecture or tune hyperparameters and train more. Yes, these are good
options, but making sure that the data is correct should be the
priority.

From the television series [*The
Newsroom*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1870479/)*¹*:

> *The first step in solving a problem is to recognize that it
> does exist.*

Difference in train vs test data is the single biggest reason for low
performing models. Image augmentations help to fight overfitting and
improve the performance of deep neural networks for Computer Vision
tasks by artificially adding more data. In this post, we will cover the
following:

1.  Overview of Computer Vision Tasks
2.  Computer Vision Pipeline
3.  Image Augmentation using Albumentations
4.  Visualize DataLoaders

If you are familiar with Computer Vision tasks and PyTorch, then feel
free to skip the first two.

## Overview of Computer Vision Tasks 

Common types of Computer Vision (CV) tasks are:

-   Image Classification
-   Image Segmentation
-   Object Detection

If you are not familiar with these Computer Vision Tasks, then check out
the post --- [Image Classification vs. Object Detection vs. Image
Segmentation](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/image-classification-vs-object-detection-vs-image-segmentation-f36db85fe81). Image augmentations help to make the model
generalize better for all 3 types of CV tasks.

## Computer Vision Pipeline 

![PyTorch
Data Pipeline](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hY7TSHLuP-fJBhdi29obVg.png)

Both Input and Target data has to go through Dataset and DataLoader
before being passed on to the model for training. It is better to
visualize the output of the DataLoader. By this way, we can also
identify when there is an issue with the Dataset definition. In relation
to the above data pipeline diagram, only Target data and Transformations
applied differs based on CV task type.

## Image Augmentation using Albumentations 

[Albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/docs/) is a fast and flexible image augmentation library. It
supports both PyTorch and Keras.
[Torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html) library is good but when it comes to Image
Segmentation or Object Detection, it requires a lot of effort to get it
right. The way of applying transformations to input data and target
label differs based on augmentation type: Pixel-level or Spatial-level.

## **Pixel-level augmentations:** 

Changes the values of pixels of the original image, but they don't
change the output mask. Image transformations such as changing
brightness or contrast of adjusting values of the RGB-palette of the
image are pixel-level augmentations. We modify the input image by
adjusting its brightness, but we keep the output mask intact.

## **Spatial-level augmentations:** 

Changes both the image and the mask. When you apply image
transformations such as mirroring or rotation or cropping a part of the
input image, you also need to apply the same transformation to the
output label to preserve its correctness.

## **Brownie Points for Albumentations:** 

-   Ability to add image augmentations to any computer vision pipeline
    with minimal effort.
-   Syntax for transforms declaration is very similar to
    Torchvision.
-   Lets you set the required probabilities and the magnitude of values
    for each transformation.

Example definition of an augmentation pipeline is as follows:

## Visualize DataLoaders 

### Why? 

Right now, probably you would be wondering if Albumentations is so great
then why do we need to visualize the DataLoaders. I'm glad you asked,
Albumentation still requires user input², and we are not that great at
providing correct values. Any rational person should think about the
type of augmentation and whether it is applicable to a particular
dataset or not, but often this is not the case.

> *It is better to visualize just to avoid any surprises.*

When rotational transformation is applied to the digit 9 from MNIST
dataset, it can be transformed to 6, but the label would still say 9.
See how easy it is to screw up data augmentation?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2zx0vNjpuSeyBxdZrokX9g.png)

### How? 

Torchvision functions like
[*make\_grid*](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/utils.html#torchvision.utils.make_grid) and
[*draw\_bounding\_boxes*](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/utils.html#torchvision.utils.draw_bounding_boxes) are quite handy, but they are not end to end. So we
will write sort of wrappers which take in the `iter` object of the DataLoaders and plot the Input and Target
data values.

Notes about the below code:

-   PyTorch Tensor expects image of shape (C x H x W) which is the
    reverse when compared to NumPy array shape (H x W x C).
-   Image data must be torch tensor of `float` data type to train the model, whereas for plotting
    it should be of type `uint8`.
-   It is best practice to avoid multiple initialization of the
    `iter`object for DataLoaders when
    possible as it is very time-consuming. This is the reason for taking
    the `iter` object as function
    parameter instead of DataLoader itself.

Once again, The focus of this post is on the output of DataLoaders, if
you are interested in the overall data pipeline then check out this

### Conclusion 

In Computer Vision, it is relatively easier to grasp what the model is
doing. How it does something is a different story, but with enough
experiments we can sort of guess what is working and what is not. The
key is to figure this out with minimal number of experiments. The more
confident we are in the data pipeline setup, more time to run various
experiments to improve the model performance. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to reach out via

\[1\] I believe that the quote from *The Newsroom* is adopted from the
below quote by [Zig
Ziglar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zig_Ziglar), but I am not too sure.

give it a go.

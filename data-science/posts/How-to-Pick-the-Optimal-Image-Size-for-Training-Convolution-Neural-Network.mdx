# How to Pick the Optimal Image Size for Training Convolution Neural Network? 

When training a Convolution Neural Network on a custom dataset, picking the right image is crucial. This will impact the training time & performance of the model. Also, we will learn how to identify if there are any issues with the dataset.

## Why? 

Before we jump to how part, Let us discuss the negative consequence of
choosing the wrong size. After we pick a fixed **width** and **height**,
the standard procedure is to resize all the images to this fixed size.
So, now every image falls into one of the two buckets.

-   *Downscaling:* Bigger images will be down scaled, this makes it
    harder for CNN to learn the features required for classification or
    detection as the number of pixels where the vital feature will be
    present is significantly reduced.
-   *Upscaling:* When small images are upscaled and padded with zero,
    then NN has to learn that the padded portion has no impact on
    classification. Larger images are also slower to train and might
    require more VRAM.

So we have to pick our poison, the closer to optimal image size we are,
the better it is.

### Optimal Image Size 

We all know that choosing the right size depends on the dataset, but the
question is how to do it? Visualize the image size.

Dataset: [The Oxford-IIIT Pet
Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/%7Evgg/data/pets/)

This dataset has more than 7000 images with varying size and resolution.

From the first plot, it looks like most images are of resolution less
than 500 by 500. After zooming in, we can clearly see that images are
clustered around either size 300 or 500. My recommendation for this
dataset is to start training the neural network with image size 300 and
progressively increase it to 400 and finish it with size 500. By this
way, the model should be able to generalize well for different image
resolutions.

## Bonus 

1.  Wouldn't it be great if we can see the underlying images while
    inspecting the points in the plot? This can help us to identify the
    following potential issues.

-   Mislabeled data: Can confuse the model.
-   Certain class images are of very high or low resolution: Could make
    the model biased.

2. After inspection, if we conclude that some data points should be
removed, then use [Lasso
Selector](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/widgets/lasso_selector_demo_sgskip.html) to achieve that.

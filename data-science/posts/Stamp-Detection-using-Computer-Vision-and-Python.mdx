## Background 

A friend of mine reach out and asked me whether I could write a program
to detect the number of [Rubber
stamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_stamp)s in an image. Apparently, these invoice receipts will
be categorized based on the number of stamps on them. Initially, I
thought of building a Deep Learning Segmentation model, but soon I
realized that it is not worth the effort.

The images are generated in a controlled environment so few computer
vision algorithms should do the trick. To illustrate the computer vision
algorithms used in detecting the stamps, I will be using a sample image
downloaded from Google as the original image is company property. The
goal is to identify two stamps in the sample image.

## Solution 

High level solution steps are:

1. Read the image.
2. Blur & detect the edges.
3. Find all contours and remove the smaller contours.
4. Fill the area inside contours & Close the blobs.
5. Filter the stamps.

Before we start let us import the necessary packages.

### 1. Read the image 

Read the color image using
[*imread*](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d4/da8/group__imgcodecs.html#ga288b8b3da0892bd651fce07b3bbd3a56) function. To display the image we will use
Matplotlib. Matplotlib expects the color image channels to be of the
order RGB, but OpenCV reads the image as BGR, so we will write a helper
function for the conversion.

### 2. Blur & detect the edges 

First, we need to convert the image to grayscale using
[cvtColor](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d8/d01/group__imgproc__color__conversions.html#ga397ae87e1288a81d2363b61574eb8cab) function. Then, we will use
[bilateralFilter](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d4/d86/group__imgproc__filter.html#ga9d7064d478c95d60003cf839430737ed) to reduce noise in the image. Bilateral filter is
preferred over Gaussian because it preserves the edges much better.
Finally, we will use
[canny](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_canny/py_canny.html) edge detector to threshold the image and detect
edges. The normal canny edge detector requires two threshold parameters
which is hard to tune, so we will use the one from [Zero-parameter,
automatic Canny edge detection with Python and
OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/04/06/zero-parameter-automatic-canny-edge-detection-with-python-and-opencv)

### 3. Find all contours and remove the smaller contours 

[findContours](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d3/dc0/group__imgproc__shape.html#ga17ed9f5d79ae97bd4c7cf18403e1689a) function can find all contours in the image. The
outermost contours are good enough for our use case, so we will use the
retrieval mode **RETR\_EXTERNAL**. **CHAIN\_APPROX\_NONE** mode is
preferred as we don't want to lose any point on the contour due to
approximation. To remove the unwanted smaller contours, we can filter
the contours by area.

> Total nr of contours found: 408

<script src="https://gist.github.com/6aravind/c8c929aad312e697336cc13d14b20c0c.js?file=Find_Contours.py"></script>



### 4. Fill the area inside contours & Close the blobs 

Instead of working on the original binary image, we will draw the top
contours on an image with black background and use this as base. Any
disconnect in the contours are easier to identify when fill the area
inside the contours using
[drawContours](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d6/d6e/group__imgproc__draw.html#ga746c0625f1781f1ffc9056259103edbc) function.

As suspected, the top stamp has a thin black line passing through it. We
need to close this blob so that the top stamp is considered as one
contour instead of two different ones. [Morphological
closing](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d4/d86/group__imgproc__filter.html#ga67493776e3ad1a3df63883829375201f) operation is perfect for achieving this.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/6aravind/c8c929aad312e697336cc13d14b20c0c.js?file=Close_Blobs.py"></script>

### 5. Filter the stamps 

To isolate the stamp contours, we can identify all the contours from the
latest binary image and filter for contours with more than 5 points
(using
[approxPolyDP](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d3/dc0/group__imgproc__shape.html#ga0012a5fdaea70b8a9970165d98722b4c)) as the stamp is an ellipse.

## Bonus --- Highlight the identified stamps 

For demo of this program, wouldn't it be cool if we can highlight only
the stamped area of the image? Since we agree that it is indeed cool,
let us see how we can achieve that.

The steps involved are:

  1. Duplicate the original image and blur the entire image.
  2. Loop through all the points in the blurred image and for the points
on or inside the stamp contour(using
[pointPolygonTest](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d3/dc0/group__imgproc__shape.html#ga1a539e8db2135af2566103705d7a5722) to check), we replace it with pixel values from the
output image. We are using pixel values from the output image because we
need the blue lines drawn over the stamps.

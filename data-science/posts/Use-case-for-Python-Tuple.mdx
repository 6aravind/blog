# Use case for Python Tuple 

Most Python programmers are guilty (me included) of always using List without even considering Tuple at all. Surely for some use cases, Tuple should be better, right? Keep reading for one such case.

Tuple is like List but immutable, so it has lesser in built methods.
Tuples are faster than Lists, but it is noticeable only when the size of
the tuple is considerably large. If you want a refresher, check out this

## Caveat
A general rule of thumb is to use Tuple only when the data will or
should not change.

```python
# Create Tuple with two elements
tup = (1, [2])

# Re-assign first element
tup[0] = 3
```

assignment.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*p2nhqwqYjSrxD2R0eQtfbA.png)

This does not mean you really can't change a tuple. If the underlying
tuple element is mutable, then we can change it. This could lead to
unintended side effects. For example, children/inherited class can
modify a tuple element initialized by the parent class.

```python
# Add element to existing List element inside Tuple
tup[1].append(3)

print(tup)
```

## Use Case 
Personally, I am more into Deep Learning and have to deal with image
files a lot. Image files have many popular formats like jpg, png and svg
etc. We often have a situation where we have to find all files of
certain types from a folder. There are many ways of going about this. We
will explore a few options.

### Option 1: Using List

The filtering based on the extension type is done with the help of
`endswith` method. Since the
`endswith` method does not accept list,
we are looping through all the extension elements. The code looks
**readable** and takes about **2 microseconds** which is not bad, but
for every extension type, we have to run through all the files one more
time. I have a suspicion that we can do much better.

### Option 2: Using Tuple

Almost similar code, but we are able to pass the entire Tuple as
parameter to the `endswith` method. This
removes the extra loop and makes the code even **shorter**. The code now
runs about **2 times faster**.

### Conclusion

Some methods like `startswith` and
`endswith` accept Tuple as parameter, if
the data does not change then better to use Tuple or convert List to
Tuple before passing data to the method. Tuples make the code look more
**elegant** and run **faster**. Also, don't forget about the **caveat**.

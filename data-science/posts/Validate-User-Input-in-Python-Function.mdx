# Validate User Input in Python Function 

Writing type hints for function arguments is a good start, but as the name suggests, it only hints at the data type of argument. When the functionality of the code depends on the data type of argument, then we must put validations in place. 

## Introduction 

Type hints are great, they help you to write better code and reduce
documentation required for external users or downstream software
developers. However, type hints do not validate the input from the user.
In my opinion, without any validation, you are playing the odds, but if
you are up for a gamble then good luck to you! For the non-gamblers, we
will explore how to do this with an example.

### Code 

Let us write a simple function (`add`)
which has a single argument `vals`. The
logic for the function is:

-   Validate that the input for `vals` argument is a `List` of either `int` or
    `string`.
-   Return a list of `integer` after
    adding 1 or list of `string` with
    period appended to the argument `vals` based on the user input.

You can validate the user input with a simple `isinstance` function. The above code works, but it\'s not scalable
for the below reasons:

1.  Have to write validations for every argument of the
    function.
2.  Probably requires a lot of effort to rewrite, when the function
    argument is modified.
3.  Don't forget about the test cases required for type
    validations.

**Tests**

*Positive:*

Positive Test Cases

*Negative:*

``` 
# Test Function add for int
add(1)
```

``` 
# Test Function add for list of float
add([1.0])
```

``` 
# Test Function add for list of mixed data types
add([1, 1.0])
```

## Better Way 

Python's type hints and
[type\_extensions](https://github.com/python/typing/tree/master/typing_extensions) is changing rapidly over the last few iterations, so
my recommendation is to use an external package like
[Typeguard](https://pypi.org/project/typeguard/) for the following reasons:

1.  Helps to abstract away the code for type validation with help of a
    decorator.
2.  Provides additional functionality (way more than what we wrote or
    need).
3.  Support for multiple Python versions have been tested.
4.  Error message is detailed and easy to understand.

To replicate our example from above, we just have to add the
`typechecked` decorator before the
function definition and remove the validations for type checks.

**Negative Tests:**

``` 
# Test Function add_ext for int
add_ext(1)
```

```

add_ext([1.])
```

```

If you are working on something serious, then don't forget to validate
user inputs. Feel free to reach out via

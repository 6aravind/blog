# Create Responsive Cards with ChakraUI

Cards can be tricky to create especially when there are images within it. In this post, we will see how to create responsive cards with the help of ChakraUI.


## Introduction 

Cards are everywhere, from [personal website](www.raravind.com/blog/web-development) to E-commerce sites. Responsive cards can make or break your website.

Okay, how? [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) makes it easy to get started especially for new developers as it provides most of the common components required for web development. Let's use cards to list down [blogs articles](www.raravind.com/blog/data-science). 


## Create Card

ChakraUI provides `Box` component which makes easier to create cards. The `as` property for the box will be *article* to play nice with the search engines.

Set the image width to 100% so that it takes the entire width. For now, we can provide a fixed value for the height of the image.
Styling the box is quite easy with the following properties 

```jsx
import { Box, Image, Text} from '@chakra-ui/react'

const Card = ({ img }) => {

  return (
    <Box  p={5} bg="cyan"  borderRadius={20} as="article">
    <Image h="350px" objectFit='fill' w="100%" src={img} alt="stock image"/>
   <h3> Title </h3> 
   <Text noOfLines={2}> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse elementum urna quam. Aenean risus turpis, aliquet id diam et, lobortis pellentesque ex. Nulla facilisi. Maecenas. </p>
    </Text>
  )
}
```

## Stacked Cards

`SimpleGrid` component is one of the many components provided by ChakraUI to stack items together. We can set the number of  cards per row using the property `columns`. 

```jsx

import { SimpleGrid} from '@chakra-ui/react'

const imgs = ["https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*KVoWyha6VfWv8rPv.jpeg",                
"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lT0rghpDqMoLma42NGOChA.png",
"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*1Nx6PRB34MtR7rzBNFROTA.png",
"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*LLr8vm1lJSaK5d9pWitkxQ.jpeg",
"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*GGKO-0fJglMqrH_J",
"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*NdxIFtI2AeW3WkTaFePRjA.jpeg",
"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UvbqhJ61omj3NqgtvvjPUQ.jpeg",
"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PhkVJnV3YUSNhSNSs-7PMg.png"];


const CardLayout = ({ imgs}) => {
  return (
    <SimpleGrid columns={3} spacing={5}>
      {imgs.map((img, index) => <Card key={index} img={img}/>)}
    </SimpleGrid>
  )
}

<CardLayout imgs={imgs} />

```

## Responsive Layout 

**Image**

This is nice but the layout does not work across the devices. By passing an array of values to the `columns` property we can make the layout responsive. How easy was that?

```jsx 

const CardResponsive = ({ imgs}) => {
  return (
    <SimpleGrid columns={[1,2,3]} spacing={5}>
      {imgs.map((img, index) => <Card key={index} img={img}/>)}
    </SimpleGrid>
  )
}
```

`useBreakpointValue` hook from ChakraUI is very powerful. This hook returns different value based on the device. 

Fixed image height does not scale across devices so we will use `useBreakpointValue` hook to fix it.

```js
const h = useBreakpointValue({base: '350px', md: '350px', xl: '300px'})
```

## Takeaway 

ChakraUI provides many similar components, knowing when to use what will take some time but this makes it easier to get started. If you like this post then follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/6aravind)

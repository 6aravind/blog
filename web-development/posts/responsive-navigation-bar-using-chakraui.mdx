## Introduction

We all know how crucial the navigation bar is for websites. But most websites don't have a good one. Why? Because responsive design for navigation bar is not easy. 

## How is the navigation bar different?


Usually when we build a [responsive layout](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/layout/stack#responsive-direction) using ChakraUI, the common approach is to stack the components horizontally for larger devices & vertically for smaller ones. This approach does not work for navigation bar. Typical navigation bar has the following components:
*  Logo 
*  Navigation menu  
*  Call to action buttons


| Desktop | Mobile |

Based on the device type, we need to rearrange the items. We will see how to build the above navigation bar in 3 steps:

1. Build desktop version
2. Build mobile version 
3. Make it responsive


## Build desktop version

The desktop version is easy to follow. Wrap all the elements inside a `Flex` with `justify` property value as "space-between". To get even spacing between navigation bar items, we will list them inside a `HStack` component.

## Build mobile version
 

1. ChakraUI provides the [Drawer component](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/overlay/drawer), which is a panel that slides out from the edge of the screen. We can place all the navigation items inside the body of the drawer for the mobile version.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/6aravind/6954653f904ed146889541c9a48fb909.js?file=drawer.js"></script>


2. We will use the useRef react hook to communicate between the menu icon and drawer. If you don't about this hook or need to refresh your memory then checkout the post [React useRef Guide by Dmitri Pavlutin](https://dmitripavlutin.com/react-useref-guide/).

3. Finally, we can add the `MobileDrawer` component next to the CTA button inside the `header.js` file.

## Make it responsive

All the hard parts are over. Now we just have to hide certain components based on the screen size. Thanks to ChakraUI it's easier than ever by using the `display` property.

1. Hide the `MobileDrawer` component in the Desktop version by adding `display={{ base: "flex", md: "none" }}` to the `Flex` component inside it.
2. Hide the Navigation Items listed inside `HStack` component in the mobile version by adding `display={{ base: "none", md: "flex" }}`.

## Conclusion 

Navigation bar is one of those things which look scary to get started but once you find a good example, it's not that hard to build. Hope you found this post to be useful. For more such posts follow/DM me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/6aravind)
